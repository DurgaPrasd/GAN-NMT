I have a throbbing pain . 
it is August fifteenth . 
could you send this to Japan ? 
the rate is one hundred twenty dollars a night . 
what newspapers do you have ? 
how do I use a safe deposit box ? 
where is the boarding gate ? 
are these all your personal effects ? 
this is instant miso soup . 
we will land in three hours . 
where is the bus stop for city hall ? 
I feel much better now . 
I hate green peppers . 
can you recommend an instructor ? 
how long does it take on foot ?
